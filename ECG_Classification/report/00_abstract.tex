Cardiovascular diseases are the prime cause of human deaths. 
Analysis and processing of ECG signals are crucial for timely diagnosis of these diseases and other cardiac abnormalities. 
In this project work, we investigate automatic ECG interpretation using the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database and heart arrhythmia classification using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
We develop several deep-learning based and traditional ML models and evaluate their performance across these tasks.
Finally, we show that transfer learning and ensemble methods can further improve performance but may inherit problems such as decreased performance across rare events or classes.
