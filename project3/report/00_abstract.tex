Brain tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue that forms because of unusual and uncontrolled cell growth in brain, which may lead to cancer. In order to avoid a fatal situation and provide the patient with necessary treatment, brain tumors must be detected as early and as accurately as possible. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technology that produces three dimensional detailed anatomical images. Quantitative features from MRI images are then extracted by computational methods called radiomics. In this project work, we apply interpretable and explainable Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods to MRI images and radiomics dataset for quicker and more accurate brain tumor detection which can help doctors make quick decisions and supplement clinical decision making. We further discuss the interpretability and explainability of our models so as to explain how our models are making decisions. As our final classifier, we choose a simple CNN model combined with SHAP and LIME post-hoc explanations that significantly improves performance upon more interpretable and classical ML models.
