It is a daunting task to keep up with medical literature. There are massive amounts of medical information and literature already available and being produced every year. Analysis and processing of this data is crucial for research purposes as well as diagnostics and treatments. Natural language processing enables computers to understand, analyze and interpret human language. In this project work, we investigate automatic classification of sentences in abstracts from biomedical literature of the PubMed dataset using NLP. We develop deep learning as well as traditional ML models and evaluate their performance on this task. Finally, we show that BERT can further improve performance.
